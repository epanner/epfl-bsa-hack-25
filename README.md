# zkVoting App

The program simulates a simple voting mechanism using a zkApp built with o1js. It deploys a smart contract that tracks votes, and then it executes a transaction that casts a “yes” vote, updating and verifying the on-chain state. The final printed output confirms that the contract correctly recorded one vote in favor.
